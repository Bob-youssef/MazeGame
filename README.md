# Project Description
This Python project is a maze game built with Pygame. The player navigates through a procedurally generated maze, and upon reaching a target cell, is presented with a randomized "button catch" mini-game. Successfully catching the button leads to a reward screen, where the player must enter a randomly generated password to claim their prize. The maze is generated using a unique traversal method that differs from traditional algorithms like BFS or DFS, providing a fresh and challenging experience.

# Installation Steps : 
1- Make Sure Python 3.x is installed 

2- Install Pygame and Qiskit library by running command : 
   pip install pygame qiskit

3- Run Main Game File : "python QRandom.py"

# Main Components : 
- Cell Class: Represents each cell in the maze grid, handling wall drawing, neighbor checks, and movement.
- changeColor Function: Smoothly transitions the background color between two specified ranges.
- Button Catch Game: A mini-game where the "Claim" button moves to random positions, making it challenging for the player to click.
- Password Check: Prompts the player for a password after the mini-game
