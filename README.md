# Project Description
This Python project is a maze game built with Pygame. The player navigates through a procedurally generated maze, and upon reaching a target cell, is presented with a randomized "button catch" mini-game. Successfully catching the button leads to a reward screen, where the player must enter a randomly generated password to claim their prize. The maze is generated using a unique traversal method that differs from traditional algorithms like BFS or DFS, providing a fresh and challenging experience.
